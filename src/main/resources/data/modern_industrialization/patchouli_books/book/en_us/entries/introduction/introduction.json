In the Steam Age, you will create your first factories that will produce the resources needed for the second part. The challenge of this stage comes from the resource management and processing time optimization. Be aware than most setup will become obsolete once your finished the Steam Age, so don't invest too much effort in it."

The setup you build at this stage are expected to be permanent as they can be continuously upgraded. The overclock system for electric machine will mean that your production will automatically adapt to your consumption. The challenge will come from building efficient and balanced process line, and prioritizing the most useful ones."

That is why it is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED to use Modern Industrialization in unison with an On-Demand Automation Mod like AE2 or Refined Storage as it will make your progress extremely slow and inefficient."
