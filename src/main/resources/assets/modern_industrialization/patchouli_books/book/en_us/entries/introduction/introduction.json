In the Steam Age, you will create your first factories that will produce the resources needed for the second part.

The overclock system for electric machines will mean that your production will automatically adapt to your consumption."

That is why it is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED to use Modern Industrialization in unison with an On-Demand Automation Mod like AE2 or Refined Storage as it will make your progress extremely slow and inefficient."
