The boiler will automatically produce and send steam to adjacent machines, up to 8 millibuckets per tick.$(br2)Bronze machines can only process recipes up to 2 EU/t, meaning that the recipe will use 2 Energy Units per Tick. As 1 millibucket of steam = 1 EU, a boiler at max temperature can power 4 machines simultaneously!"
