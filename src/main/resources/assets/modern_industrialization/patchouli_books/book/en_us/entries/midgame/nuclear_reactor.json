It will turn into Steam that can then be used to produce power, possibly by running it through a Heat Exchanger first.$(br2)The Nuclear Reactor is also the only way to produce some materials such as Plutonium.$(br2)Finally, it can produce fluids used for nuclear fusion: Deuterium and Tritium."

The heat will naturally move to an adjacent hatch or to the outside if the hatch is on the edge (the heat is then lost). The speed of this process is equal to the hatches content's heat transfer coefficient (shown in REI) times the temperature difference. The heat can also be extracted in a fluid hatch by producing steam. A temperature above an item's maximum temperature will destroy it."

If the scattered neutron is fast, it has a chance of slowing down, becoming a thermal one. This transfers the energy from the neutron to the hatch in the form of heat. An absorbed neutron stops its course and also transfers its energy if it was a fast neutron."
